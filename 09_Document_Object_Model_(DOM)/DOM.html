      document.body.innerHTML = 'Hello'; // This code removes everything on page and replaces it with text 'hello'. So in this code, it will remove the button and replace it with 'hello'. 
      // "document" is a built in object
      // ".body" means we are accessing property of document called 'body'. 'body' is also an object.
      // ".innerHTML" is accessing property of 'body' object called 'innerHTML'.
      // "= 'hello'" means we are changing "innerHTML" property to "hello".
      // When we change "innerHTML" property, it also changes the webpage which means "document" object and web-page are connected somehow. 

      document.title = 'Good job' // Same explanation as above. 

      // This suggests that the document object mpdels the webpage.
